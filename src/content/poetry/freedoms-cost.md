She who, like the touch of my Lord, redeems with love and affection, my sweet love, how can I repay you?

Your kisses are what fill me with the same love that saved me. I believe you are a tool of the Redeemer himself. I give thanks for that, because I have the privilege of seeing and feeling you in my skin.
