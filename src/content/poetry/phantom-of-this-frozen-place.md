## I

*Because I have you and not because I think of you*  
*because the night is open-eyed*  
*because the night passes and I say love*  

*because you have come to collect your image*  
*and you are better than all your images*  
*because you are beautiful from your feet to your soul*  

*because you are good from your soul to me*  
*because you hide sweetly in pride*  
*small and sweet*  
*heart armor*

## II

*because you are mine*  
*because you are not mine*  
*because I look at you and die*  

*and worse than I die*  
*if I don't look at you, love*  
*if I don't look at you*  

## III

*because you always exist everywhere*  
*but you exist better where I love you*  
*because your mouth is blood*  
*and you are cold*  

*I have to love you, love*  
*I have to love you*  
*even if this wound hurts like two*  
*even if I look for you and don't find you*  

## IV

*and even if*  
*the night passes and I have you*  
*and not.*
