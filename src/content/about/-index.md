I am a proactive Software Development Technologist, about to complete my training in Software Analysis and Development. As a self-taught programmer, I am proficient in back-end technologies such as PHP and Python, and have skills in front-end (React, Redux, JavaScript) and database management. Currently, I co-lead a robust software project for a real-life company, applying and perfecting my skills to deliver efficient solutions. My interest extends to DevOps, a field I aim to delve into during my upcoming internship. My strengths in problem-solving, adaptability, teamwork, and effective communication allow me to integrate and collaborate efficiently on any project.
